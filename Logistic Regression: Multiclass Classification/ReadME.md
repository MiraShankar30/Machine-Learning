## Logistic regression: Multiclass classification

Used sklearn.datasets iris flower dataset to train the model using logistic regression. 
In iris dataset there are 150 samples containing following features,

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width

Using above 4 features clasified a flower in one of the three categories,

Setosa
Versicolour
Virginica

Accuracy of the model found and used that to predict different samples in the test dataset. 
Built a Confusion matrix that shows how many prediction are correct and incorrect per class.
