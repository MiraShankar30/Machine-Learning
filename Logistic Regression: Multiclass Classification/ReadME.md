## Logistic regression: Multiclass classification

Used sklearn.datasets iris flower dataset to train the model using logistic regression. 
In iris dataset there are 150 samples containing following features,<br>
<br>
Sepal Length<br>
Sepal Width<br>
Petal Length<br>
Petal Width<br>

Using above 4 features clasified a flower in one of the three categories,<br>
<br>
Setosa<br>
Versicolour<br>
Virginica<br>
<br>
Accuracy of the model found and used that to predict different samples in the test dataset. 
Built a Confusion matrix that shows how many prediction are correct and incorrect per class.
